_Changes for v 7.7_:
- App now supports `DP16` packages format. It supports different structures for compressed and regular packages without loosing an achieved compression level;
- Removed the requirement check for `DirectX` and `DotNet8`;
- Adjusted the deployment algorithm: the app will now open additional URLs only manually;
- Fixed some misleading tips;
- New videoguides have been added;
- DPArray now supports the internal compression algorithm. External `7z` utility will no longer be needed for deploying large packages
