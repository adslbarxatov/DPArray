_Changes for v 6.1_:
- Remote processing of the packages list has been replaced with the file downloading. Now app holds the copy of the list and can operate it a bit faster and even without an internet connection. So, it is possible now to workaround some of possible incompatibilities in the future (this update caused by one of them). At least, you will be able to open webpages of projects to update them manually;
- The startup logo will now show up only once;
- Updated the interface of message boxes;
- App size has been decreased by removing extraneous functionality;
- Added UTF32 encoding;
- The interface was adapted to Windows 10, incorrect window borders were fixed;
- Implemented the direct info URLs for the packages manager (without their downloading);
- All options for packages in the list are now available through the context menu (use right mouse button)
