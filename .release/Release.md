_Changes for v 6.6.1_:
- Version `DP13` of package formats has been deprecated (old monolanguage script);
- Version `DP15` of package formats has been implemented (new script without obsolete fields);
- Fixed incorrect version detection for ESHQ and ESRM;
- Fixed some minor inconveniences;
- Upgraded the packages list: the script is now more flexible and universal;
- Upgraded the packages processing algorithm: app is now able to check versions and PCCs using the packages list;
- PCC and version markers will be removed from infopages;
- Removed some redundant code and processing procedures;
- App now allows you to change the deployment settings without exiting from mini-launcher;
- `.dpd` files for DPArray now work as settings mode shortcuts (instead of deinstallation mode that is impossible for DPArray);
- Implemented the startup shortcuts creation on the level of deployment app (DPArray);
- Now you can add / remove shortcut to / from the startup menu during the deployment / updating of the product;
- Startup property in the mini-launcher has been removed; you need to start the DPArray again after update to manage it;
- Deselection of Start menu shortcuts and desktop shortcuts will remove them even if you arenâ€™t removing the product;
- DPArray is now locked in default deployment mode (support for the fast deployment has been disabled due to importance of manual settings for shortcuts)
