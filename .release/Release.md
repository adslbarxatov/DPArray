_Changes for v 6.1.5_:
- Implemented the access rights checker: it will test the availability of the Windows registry and the application placement for writing and notify user about possible problems;
- Updated the storage method of text tips;
- Updated some text tips;
- Rewritten the settings operator: it should fix problems with requiring administrator rights;
- Remote processing of the packages list has been replaced with the file downloading. Now app holds the copy of the list and can operate it a bit faster and even without an internet connection. So, it is possible now to workaround some of possible incompatibilities in the future (this update caused by one of them). At least, you will be able to open webpages of projects to update them manually;
- The startup logo will now show up only once;
- Updated the interface of message boxes;
- App size has been decreased by removing extraneous functionality
