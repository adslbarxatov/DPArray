_Changes for v 6.2_:
- App is now able to cache the list of descriptions for available packages;
- App is now able to display view-only projects in the main list: there will be non-deployable packages that can be used to access to some important web-resources;
- Packages for deployment now can be selected by left double-click; fast mode will be enabled automatically where applicable;
- Some of internal mechanics have been improved;
- Cumulative updates have been applied;
- Implemented the access rights checker: it will test the availability of the Windows registry and the application placement for writing and notify user about possible problems;
- Rewritten the settings operator: it should fix problems with requiring administrator rights;
- Remote processing of the packages list has been replaced with the file downloading. Now app holds the copy of the list and can operate it a bit faster and even without an internet connection. So, it is possible now to workaround some of possible incompatibilities in the future (this update caused by one of them). At least, you will be able to open webpages of projects to update them manually
