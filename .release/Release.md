_Changes for v 6.2.2_:
- App is now able to cache descriptions for packages. After the first connection it will not require their re-downloading until userâ€™s request (by clearing cache) or changing of an interface language;
- Cumulative updates have been applied;
- App is now able to display view-only projects in the main list: there will be non-deployable packages that can be used to access to some important web-resources;
- Packages for deployment now can be selected by left double-click; fast mode will be enabled automatically where applicable;
- Some of internal mechanics have been improved
